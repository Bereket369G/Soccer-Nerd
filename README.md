## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is set up using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and modern development experience. Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or later) and a package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository** (If you haven't already)
    Open your terminal and clone the project files to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/soccer-nerds.git
    cd soccer-nerds
    ```

2.  **Set Up TheSportsDB API Key**
    This application requires an API key from TheSportsDB to fetch match data.

    - Visit [TheSportsDB API](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php) and get your free API key.
    - Open the file `lib/api.ts`.
    - Replace the placeholder key `'123'` with your actual API key:

    ```typescript
    // lib/api.ts

    const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace '123' with your key
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    This will install React, Vite, and all other necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server**
    This command will start the application in development mode.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). The server supports hot-reloading, so changes you make to the code will be reflected instantly.

2.  **Build for Production**
    To create an optimized production build of the app, run:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate a `dist` folder with all the static assets ready for deployment.
