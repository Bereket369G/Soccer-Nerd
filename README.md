## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or later) and a package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/soccer-nerds.git
    cd soccer-nerds
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set Up TheSportsDB API Key**
    This application requires an API key from TheSportsDB to fetch match data.

    - Visit [TheSportsDB API](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php) and get your free API key.
    - Open the file `lib/api.ts`.
    - Replace the placeholder key `'123'` with your actual API key:

    ```typescript
    // lib/api.ts

    const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace '123' with your key
    const BASE_URL = `https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/${API_KEY}`;

    // ... rest of the file
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server**
    This command will start the application in development mode and open it in your default browser. The server supports hot-reloading.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

2.  **Build for Production**
    To create an optimized production build of the app, run:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    This will generate a `dist` folder with all the static assets ready for deployment.
